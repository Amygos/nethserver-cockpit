# Translations

The UI uses a simple JSON file to handle translations.
Translations files are saved inside the repository under the `ui/src/i18n/` directory.

Each file name is in the form `locale-<lang>.json` where `<lang>` is the language code.
The source file of all translations is the `locale-en.json` file.

Translations are handled using [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/nethserver/nethserver/dashboard/).

## Pushing translations

Make sure to have a Transifex account and the [client](https://docs.transifex.com/client/introduction) is installed.

When a new string is added inside the `local-en.json file`, remember to push it to Transifex:
```
tx push -s
```

## Pulling translations

Once in a while, remember to pull new translations and commit everything inside the repository.

First, pull all available languages:
```
tx pull -s
```

If needed, add new languages to the repository:
```
git add ui/src/i18n/locale-it.json
```

Finally, commit everything:
```
git commit -a -m "Pull translations: add Italian"
```
